## The Code Challenge

### The Main Task
In this section, you have to build a checkout page. You will find below a description of the requirements. Based on the requirements, and with the help of our documentation, you should determine the integration method to be used as well as which payment methods to provide. You should then code a minimalistic checkout page with all the necessary functionalities and features.

## The Solution

Django with Vue.js is very powerful, very easy to use and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

### The Packages 

- Axios for APIs requests
- Bulma for rendering the webpages
